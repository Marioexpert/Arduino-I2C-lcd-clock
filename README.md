This was made REALLY quick, if there are bugs tell me in the issues tabs

 -What you will need to have : 
  LCD I2C library, an Arduino (ofc) and a lcd display (16 by 2 is good)

  
You could use a non-I2C but you'll have to configure it by yourself :/

# Features that i'll (maybe) add :

  -12/24h Mode
  -A way to set the time

Credits :

 Myself/the one who made the LCDI2C library
